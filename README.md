# mean_squad
The repo for our Software Engineering course.  
Before proceeding you need to install nodejs and mongoDB

## Running Node
In this directory you will find a package.json file which contains the dependencies(packages)
that we need and are using in our project.  
So to install the dependencies in package.json you should run:

```
npm install
```
Then to run the project:

```
node server
```
You should now find the website running on http://127.0.0.1:8080/

### Quick look
This project uses the MVC concept which we used in our Game course semester 4.  
There are some sub directories in this project: 

1. routes
..* contains files which will have the routes. for example if we want to access the home page which is 
at http://127.0.0.1:8080/ . The server will go looking for that link in the routes.js file, then call a function accordingly.
2. views
..* contains the ejs files, which are html files but using a package called ejs which will help us pass variables to the html page.
3. models
..* this is where we keep our schemas, similar to DB1 course we specify the fields we want and their types
We will also use a model to connect to DB for fetching and inserting records
